        <p>
            The "rules" for this server are pretty simple and straightforward, but it all boils down to one principle: have fun without ruining somebody else's.
            Here are a few "dos" and "don'ts" to help illustrate:
        </p>
        <h4>Do</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Mark out areas that you intend to build in</li>
            <li>Talk to nearby players about themes and plans before building in a new area</li>
            <li>Ask before modifying another player's build</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Don't</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Destory other player's builds (or dramatically alter terrain near them) without permission</li>
            <li>Steal items from other players</li>
            <li>Maliciously kill other players (duals, mini games, challenges are fine)</li>
        </ul>
