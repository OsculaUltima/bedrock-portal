                The My Account link has been place with a user information panel. In this panel you will see four statistics, as well
                as the My Account and Logout links.

                    This is how many hours you have left on the Minecraft whitelist. After this time you will need to purchase more time.
                    Time is cumulative, so purchasing one week in the store while you have time remaining will add 168 hours to your
                    current time.

            <h3>Store</h3>
            <p>
                The store is a page where you can buy both in-game items and site items. Nothing here can ever be purchased with real money.
            </p>
            <p>
                Any items that you can afford will have a yellow "Purchase" button. Items which you cannot afford have a greyed out
                "Purchase" button. It is recommended that you remain logged onto the Minecraft server when purchasing in game items, as
                many of them use your current player position or add items directly to your inventory.
            </p>
            <h4>Credits</h4>
            <p>
                Store credits can be earned in several ways (and more may be added in the future). First, you earn a small number of
                credits every time that you <b>post a message on Discord.</b> Second, every 24 hours you become eligable for a much larger
                <b>daily login bonus</b>, which is automatically claimed by logging on to the Minecraft server. Third (coming soon), whenever
                you spend credits in the store you recieve a small percentage back as <b>gift credits</b>. These gift credits can be given
                to any other player at any time, which will then be converted to regular credits for them.
