Any .html file in this directory can be read in by the application and displayed using /home/static/FileName

e.g.

You add MyStaticFile.html, whith some fancy html in it. Now all you need to do is navigate to /home/static/MyStaticFile and it will get rendered inside
the normal application UI.

If you want a navbar link, add it to the StaticMenuLinks section in appsettings.json

See the sample CommunityGuidelines.html for an example
